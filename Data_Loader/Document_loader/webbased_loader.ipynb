      "LangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs. With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more. LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.\n",
      "We recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.\n",
      "LangChain agents are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.\n",

LangChain standardizes how you interact with models so that you can seamlessly swap providers and avoid lock-in.Learn moreEasy to use, highly flexible agentLangChain’s agent abstraction is designed to be easy to get started with, letting you build a simple agent in under 10 lines of code. But it also provides enough flexibility to allow you to do all the context engineering your heart desires.Learn moreBuilt on top of LangGraphLangChain’s agents are built on top of LangGraph.
