Closed-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a statement that requires a response.\\nA closed-ended question contrasts with an open-ended question, which cannot easily be answered with specific information.\\n\\n\\n== Examples ==\\nExamples of closed-ended questions that may elicit a \"yes\" or \"no\" response include:\\n\\nWere you born in 2010?\\nIs Lyon the capital of France?\\nDid you steal the money?\\nSimilarly, variants of the above closed-ended questions that possess specific responses are:\\n\\nOn what day were you born? (\"Saturday.\")\\nWhat is the capital of France? (\"Paris.\")\\nWhere did you steal the money from? (\"The bank.\")\\nAt the same time, there are closed-ended questions that are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: \"Have you stopped taking heroin?\" (if you never took it) or \"Who told you to take heroin?\"; see \"loaded question\" and \"\"leading question\".\\nA study by the University of Cincinnati found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of social pressure, using context clues to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional Metallic Metals Act.\\n\\n\\n== Alternative formulations ==\\nThere are alternative names for the same concept. There is an entry in \"A Dictionary of Psychology – Oxford Reference\" for \"closed question\" for the concept described here. Statistics for search queries show \"closed question\" is coming more often than \"close ended question\" and \"closed-ended question\". Statistics from \"ngram\" show \"closed question\" is twice more frequent than \"closed-ended question\" in books.\\n\\n\\n== In education ==\\nSome in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking \"bad\" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.\\nPeter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley\\'s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are \"grammatically closed, but conceptually open\". For example, in standard parlance, \"Is it ever right to lie?\" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be \"opened up\" by the questioner (\"Why do you think that?\", \"Could there be an instance where that\\'s not the case?\"), inviting elaboration and enquiry.\\nThis grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, \"gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question\". Closed questions, simply require \"opening up\" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.\\nWorley\\'s structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention \"Open Questioning Mindset\" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of students\\' contributions and look for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that '),\n",

A territorial dispute is a disagreement over the possession or control of land between two or more political entities.

An estimated 6,000 Tibetans fled to Bhutan and were granted asylum, although Bhutan subsequently closed its border to China, fearing more refugees to come. In July 1959, along with the occupation of Tibet, the Chinese People's Liberation Army occupied several Bhutanese exclaves in western Tibet which were under Bhutanese administration for more than 300 years and had been given to Bhutan by Ngawang Namgyal in the 17th century.

      "In 1958, Ayub Khan led Pakistan's first military coup, becoming Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and later President until 1969. During his tenure, the U.S. delivered substantial economic and military aid, despite Pakistan's governance by military regime, and amidst events like the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965.\n",
      "Yahya Khan succeeded Ayub in 1969, holding power during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 which led to the secession of East Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh. Under Yahya, the U.S. provided adequate economic but minimal military aid.\n",
      "Civilian governance of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto resumed from 1971 to 1977, during which the U.S. offered modest economic support and withheld military aid as Pakistan finalized its constitution, establishing a parliamentary democracy.\n",
      "Following another military coup in 1977, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq led the country. In April 1979, President Jimmy Carter halted all aid, excluding food assistance, due to Pakistan's efforts to establish a uranium enrichment facility, following Symington Amendment. Initial U.S. aid was limited, increasing significantly after geopolitical shifts such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the fall of the Shah of Iran. U.S. sanctions imposed in April 1979 due to Pakistan's nuclear activities were lifted by the end of the year in light of these events.\n",
      "Between 1988 and 1999, under civilian and democratic governments, U.S. aid was low, particularly after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. The aid was suspended in the 1990s under President George H. W. Bush, who cited concerns over Pakistan's developing nuclear program. Relations between the two countries deteriorated as the U.S. implemented the Pressler Amendment. This amendment led to severe sanctions against Pakistan, exacerbating economic challenges for the country's nascent civilian government. Consequently, all forms of bilateral aid from the U.S. to Pakistan were halted. The once expansive operations of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Pakistan, which had employed over 1,000 staff across the country, were dramatically reduced almost overnight. Further complications arose from U.S. sanctions following Pakistan's nuclear tests in 1998, which were conducted in response to similar tests by India.\n",
