      "LangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs. With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more. LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.\n",
      "We recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.\n",

But it also provides enough flexibility to allow you to do all the context engineering your heart desires.Learn moreBuilt on top of LangGraphLangChain’s agents are built on top of LangGraph.
