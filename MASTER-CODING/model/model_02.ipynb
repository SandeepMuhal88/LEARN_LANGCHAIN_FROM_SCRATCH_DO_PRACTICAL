Python's syntax is user-friendly, and its vast library ecosystem simplifies complex operations such as machine learning and data mining. In this article, we'll be discussing the most popular and efficient libraries for data science in Python and how to utilize them.\\n\\nGenerally, when learning Python for data science, it's essential to acquire expertise with the following libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and PyTorch. Let's dive into each library's functionalities and use cases!\\n\\nNumPy:\\nNumPy is an important library in Python for data science as it provides data structures, operations, and math functions working on these structures. This library is a module for the Python programming language that allows us to work with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a wide variety of high-level mathematical functions. These arrays are created from Python variables that store a huge number of elements or numbers. NumPy means Numerical Python, which is why its name stands for Numerical Python. It provides high-performance arrays and operations on them; it is used to perform arithmetics, mathematical operations, and array functions. Generally, NumPy provides an efficient alternative to Python lists, and it effectively improves the processing speed of mathematical functions. NumPy arrays are more efficient because they are contiguous memory-layout and allow elementwise operations, and it's easy to perform mathematical operations like dot products, transposing, etc. NumPy arrays are homogenous, and which can store elements of multiple data types. It's an essential library for numerical computations.\\n\\nPandas:\\nPandas is a known library for data manipulation and analysis. Pandas provide us with data structures like DataFrame, DataSeries, and Panel. These datastructures are built on top of Numpy arrays to manipulate, clean, and analyze the data. It provides basic functionality like grouping, merging, filtering, sorting, and aggregations. DataFrames allow us to manipulate and analyze numerical data, and Series is used to store and work with one-dimensional arrays. It enables data cleaning,\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 512, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 525}, 'model_name': 'HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta', 'system_fingerprint': '', 'finish_reason': 'length', 'logprobs': None} id='lc_run--9181bcc9-a947-4ade-9d7a-e957bcf89386-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 512, 'total_tokens': 525}\n"
